        The first thing I started with in the project was to create a very
        simple test program to see if it was realistic for me to be able to
        create a text program in the time I was given.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I ended up with this program. Very basic functionality, but it
        still showed me that it was possible for me to create a text program. I
        also looked at a couple of different videos about creating a text
        program, like this example. <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la-0HOaNL10"

    <div>
      <p>
        The next thing I chose was to write a list of tasks I had to do to
        complete the project. I used Notion to organize my tasks. I ended up
        dividing my tasks into three main categories: Research, prototype, and
        development. After creating all my goals, I chose to emphasize
        development the most and at the same time allocate the most time to it.
        Because I knew it was going to be the most time-consuming part.

    <h3>Software testing</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        When I started on research, I chose to start by looking at other text
        programs to get a better insight into how they work. The programs I
        tested were Notion, Obsidian, Word, OneNote, TinyMCE, and CKEditor.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I concluded from these programs was that they all had poor
        usability for people who use a keyboard, or that certain functions
        cannot be used without a mouse.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <section>
        <h4>Notion</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          The program works quite well and is easy to use because line heights
          and text sizes are set for you, but it is not possible to override
          these standard sizes. To add elements like lists, bullet points, or
          headings, you use / commands. Unfortunately, Notion has not taken into
          account people who cannot see or have impaired vision, because there
          is no screen reader available in the web version. The screen reader
          problem is solved in the downloaded version, but it is not possible to
          switch to many languages in this version so you still do not get a
          screen reader in Norwegian.
          <span class="line-break"
            >Another problem with Notion is that when you use keyboard
            navigation, there is a poor explanation of what buttons do. So most
            of the buttons have the same names when you navigate between your
            pages and Notion does not read the names of the pages. Then it
            becomes very difficult to find out which file you are opening and I
            also cannot figure out how to open a file with keyboard navigation.</span

        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Obsidian</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          Obsidian functions partly as a cross between Notion and VSCode. A big
          advantage I see with Obsidian is that you have the opportunity to edit
          almost all shortcuts in the program so that it fits you as best as
          possible. I think the program seems to have better functionality than
          Notion, but there is more to learn in terms of shortcuts.<span
            class="line-break"
            >Obsidian also has a small problem in that I do not see any easy way
            to create columns or other text formatting that is not to change
            text size or lists. Images are also a bit difficult to place because
            I find no easy way to add images that do not take up their own line.<span
              class="line-break"
              >Even so, I believe that Notion is a bit better at formatting the
              text than Obsidian.</span

    </div>
    <div>
      <section>
        <h4>Word</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          Word is quite good in the form that you have a lot of templates and
          full possibility to edit your text completely freely. When I tested
          Word with a screen reader, I found no problems that were
          insurmountable, but adding images in Word can be quite difficult. It
          is also almost impossible to adjust image placement with the keyboard
          alone. This is not just a problem with keyboard navigation. This is
          just how Word is.
          <span class="line-break">
            As far as I could see, the screen reader worked perfectly, but Word
            has tons of buttons so it can take a very long time to use keyboard
            navigation because you have to go past very many buttons.</span

          <li><h5>Good</h5></li>

          <li>Didn't see any issue with Narrator</li>
          <li>Can navigate the entire app with keyboard</li>
          <li>Can change all keyboard shortcuts</li>
          <li><h5>Bad</h5></li>
          <li>Too many buttons</li>
          <li>Extremely difficult to place images</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>OneNote</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          OneNote seems to have mostly the same features as Word, but They have
          been partially simplified which is an advantage so that it does not
          have to be how many buttons you need to press to navigate with
          keyboard.
          <span class="line-break">
            The screen reader also seems to work perfectly with OneNote, but
            image placement is even worse in OneNote than Word. I don't think so
            is possible to scale down images without using the mouse, but I saw
            it was possible to add alt text. Unfortunately, I don't know how i
            can do it with keyboard.<span class="line-break">
              OneNote also has a feature that allows you to create text boxes
              wherever than you want on the whole page and this you actually
              have the opportunity to do with keyboard only if you want, but
              there's no saying where you are when you use screen reader.<span
                class="line-break"
                >A big problem with OneNote is that you can't navigate between
                the different notebooks you have or between pages you here in
                the notepad.</span

    <div>
      <section>
        <h4>TinyMCE</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          TinyMCE has pretty good functionality. From as far as I could see, I
          have no problems with Narrator. It was also very simplified with How
          many buttons were there and the buttons that existed were grouped
          under other elements so that you pushed past a group instead of every
          button. There was also a help button available with all the shortcuts
          that are convenient.
          <span class="line-break">
            One problem is that the top bar with all the buttons has a tab index
            of -1 which prevents you from using Shift Tab to get to Buttons.
            Instead, press Alt + F9. It's a problem if you sitting on a PC with
            an NVIDEA graphics card because then you have a program with the
            same shortcut. So then you can't reach the top menu without changing
            that shortcut.<span class="line-break">
              Also, you cannot place images through keyboard alone. You must
              Drag the image into the file and it is also not possible to place
              Images made easy with keyboard alone.</span

        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>CKEditor</h4>
        <p class="margin-top">
          CKEditor seems to work quite similarly to TinyMCE and then has a lot
          of the same features. Some of the biggest differences I saw were that
          CKEditor had several templates for fonts that you could use. This is
          very convenient.
          <span class="line-break">
            At the same time, I saw it was possible to place images and change
            The size of the images to fit the text. I didn't find Some
            possibility get to do it with keyboard, but it's good that you can
            Place the image easily.<span class="line-break">
              A bigger problem with CKEditor was one I didn't figure out how to
              should be able to navigate their way to the top menu without the
              use of a mouse.<span class="line-break"
                >The buttons in the top menu were also less organized than
                TinyMCE and When navigating between them, I had to select all
                elements of the button before I got to move on. So first marked
                I saw the graphic inside the button.

        When I finished researching, I started with a wireframe so that I be

        <span class="line-break"

          process I spent over 2 weeks on because this was far more complicated

          web or I have written it with the help of ChatGPT. I just started by
          entering the most basic ones features such as. To set text right, left

        When I user-tested this version, the user should write the same one The

        My user tests were done with a person who couldn't see the screen. This
        was done with a button that made the entire screen black but could Use
        only screen reader and keyboards. The other two could see, but had to
        still use the keyboard. I didn't get very many concretes feedback from
        the user test, but I got some input and The users found a couple of
        errors that I wouldn't have found myself without others had tested the
        program. One important thing I noticed when people tested was that no
        one chose to set their own text size. Everyone would rather Use the
        predefined sizes. So then I removed the option of to set my own sizes
        even though I originally wanted it because it provides A little more

      When it came to color, I'd gotten feedback that someone would rather that
      the website should be dark so then I chose to look at some dark colors
      Palettes. I chose to use the last color palette.

        When it came to creating the landing page there weren't many problems I
        support on. This only thing I had problem with was the animation on
        website. It was because the wrong element had a class of animation.

        When I finished the website I worked on trying and doing text program
        better, but when I worked with it I noticed that I had been over
        ambitious when I had set up features I should create. I ended up cutting
        out half of those. The most Complicated feature that was left behind was
        adding images.
